<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome!</h1>
<p>Thank you for exploring my project! This app is born out of my love for road cycling and the joy of discovering cyclist-friendly cafes. I'm committed to maintaining and enhancing this app, making sure that it remains accessible to fellow cyclists eager to share their favorite cafes. Their feedback is invaluable, and I will continue improving usability and adding new features based on their suggestions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">‚òïÔ∏èCoffee & Wifi üíª</h2>
<p>This Python script implements a web application using the Flask framework
for managing information about cafes. The application allows users to view a
list of cafes, add new cafes, edit existing cafe details, and delete cafes
from the database.</p>
